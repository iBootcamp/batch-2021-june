  - ## Alias

Alias simply means an alternative name. We can use aliases to serve as substitutes for commands in Git which can create following advantages:

- Long commands can be shortened and thus made more memorable.
- Commands that is used frequently can be shortened for more efficient use.

### How to define and use aliases

You can use _git config_ command with the alias and the command you want to substitute. For example, to create the alias _p_ for _git push_:

> $ git config --global alias.p 'push'

This enables us to use the command _git p_ like any other git command whenever you have to use _git push_ command.

To see all your aliases:

> $ git config --global -l

Regardless of the method you use, defining aliases improves your overall experience with Git.
