Repositories &amp; exercises of batch 2021 july.

## `PREFACE`

```
   This file and repository falls under the joint collaboration of students who participated in the Ibootcamp's very first session of lessons regarding git and github for absolute beginners. Batch-2021-june is the starting project that contains the depiction of the students' experiences while learning at this bootcamp with the hopes of creating a valuable asset for the future campers and beginners as well as to keep the track of our own development.

## Git

- Introduction

  - Git
    Git is a software which is used to in our local computer(PC or laptop) to track file or folders which contains data of users and saves the files or folders date for future use. Git is mordern way of saving, protecting and sharing our program files. Git is also known as version control software. Version control simply means the way of managing changes of the softwar code or application code with previous version and we can easily track previous data easily. Git can be used for personal use or office use(team use).We can use git with command line(Git bash) or with git GUI. There are other Git GUI interfaces which are easy to use example tortoise-git (https://tortoisegit.org/download/).

  - Github
    Github is a online cloude aka online storage where we can keep our program file and documents mostly software data or codes over there. Github makes use of git hence we can view our commits and changes in github aslw well. We use git command to push local data(PC data) from our local repository(add link) to Github repository(Remote). In github we can get open source code and use it freely by cloning in our local computer. There are other similiar platform like gitlab bitbucket and many more.

  - ## Alias

Alias simply means an alternative name. We can use aliases to serve as substitutes for commands in Git which can create following advantages:

- Long commands can be shortened and thus made more memorable.
- Commands that is used frequently can be shortened for more efficient use.

### How to define and use aliases

You can use _git config_ command with the alias and the command you want to substitute. For example, to create the alias _p_ for _git push_:

> $ git config --global alias.p 'push'

This enables us to use the command _git p_ like any other git command whenever you have to use _git push_ command.

To see all your aliases:

> $ git config --global -l

Regardless of the method you use, defining aliases improves your overall experience with Git.
