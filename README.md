## How to write a markdown

## Git

- Introduction
  - Git
    >Git is a software which is used to in our local computer(PC or laptop) to track file or folders which contains data of users and saves the files or folders date for future use. Git is mordern way of saving, protecting and sharing our program files. Git is also known as version control software. Version control simply means the way of managing changes of the softwar code or application code with previous version and we can easily track previous data easily. Git can be used for personal use or office use(team use).We can use git with command line(Git bash) or with git GUI. There are other Git GUI interfaces which are easy to use example tortoise-git (https://tortoisegit.org/download/).

  - Github
    >Github is a online cloude aka online storage where we can keep our program file and documents mostly software data or codes over there. Github makes use of git hence we can view our commits and changes in github aslw well. We use git command to push local data(PC data) from our local repository(add link) to Github repository(Remote). In github we can get open source code and use it freely by cloning in our local computer. There are other similiar platform like gitlab bitbucket and many more.

    <br>
    ![clone](photos/clone/clone.png)
