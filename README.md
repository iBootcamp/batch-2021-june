  - ## Alias  

Alias simply means an alternative name. We can use aliases to serve as substitutes for commands in Git which can create following advantages:  

  * Long commands can be shortened and thus made more memorable.  
  * Commands that is used frequently can be shortened for more efficient use.  

### How to define and use aliases  

You can use *git config* command with the alias and the command you want to substitute. For example, to create the alias *p* for *git push*:  

>$ git config --global alias.p 'push'  

This enables us to use the command *git p* like any other git command whenever you have to use *git push* command.  
 
To see all your aliases:  

>$ git config --global -l  

Regardless of the method you use, defining aliases improves your overall experience with Git.
