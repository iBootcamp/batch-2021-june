## How to write a markdown

## Git

- Introduction
  - Git
    Git is a software which is used to in our local computer(PC or laptop) to track file or folders which contains data of users and saves the files or folders date for future use. Git is mordern way of saving, protecting and sharing our program files. Git is also known as version control software. Version control simply means the way of managing changes of the softwar code or application code with previous version and we can easily track previous data easily. Git can be used for personal use or office use(team use).We can use git with command line(Git bash) or with git GUI. There are other Git GUI interfaces which are easy to use example tortoise-git (https://tortoisegit.org/download/).

  - Github
    Github is a online cloude aka online storage where we can keep our program file and documents mostly software data or codes over there. Github makes use of git hence we can view our commits and changes in github aslw well. We use git command to push local data(PC data) from our local repository(add link) to Github repository(Remote). In github we can get open source code and use it freely by cloning in our local computer. There are other similiar platform like gitlab bitbucket and many more.

  - branch (default) <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Default branch is a branch from where we start our work whenever we open Git .It is the default branch in Git. All the pull requests and commits are made against this branch only unless the user specifies any other branch. While we already get a default branch set up called a master branch, GitHub provides the user with an option to change that. 
  -  Status <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  Status  command is the command in git that displays the state of the working directory and the staging area . It lets us see what changes have been made. Mostly, it is used to display the state between Git Add and Git commit . <br> To use a status command in git we execute command : $ git status command once the file is created.  
  - add <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; add command is a command in git that adds the changes made in the working directory to the staging area. It is an important command , without it no git commit would ever do anything. <br> To add a particular file , we use the command : $ git add whereas to add all changed file we use command: $ git add . command. 
  - commit
  - alias
  - diff
  - Advanced branch
